# FAU Web Development Project 3 - *Amphible Quiz*

Submitted by: **Peyton Adkins**

This web app: **This is a continuation of the previous Amphible Quiz project with added features and responsive animations. Some of the features requested in the assignment specifications I had already implemented as bonus features prior.**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
- [X] **Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect**
- [X] **A back button is displayed on the card and can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence**
- [X] **A next button is displayed on the card and can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards
- [X] A user's answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer
- [X] A counter displays the user's current and longest streak of correct responses
- [ ] A user can mark a card that they have mastered and have it removed from the pool of answers as well as added to a list of mastered cards

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Added a start menu with instructions and the ability to control the size of the batch of cards.
* [X] Added animations to reshuffling cards, getting a card wrong, and getting a card correct.

The following features that have the potential to be implemented:

## Notes

A lot of the small things (automatic card flipping, seqeuncing animations, ensuring no duplicates, etc) added to the total time of making this simple app. I wanted to give the best user experience possible, and thus dedicated much of my time to that. I had originally wanted to add more flavor to each question with a unique in-house graphic, but that would have potentially doubled the total development time. Also, there were many bugs with mobile variants of this app in the previous iteration that were not apparent when 'replicated' with a desktop browser (Google Chrome, Safari, and FireFox).
